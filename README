4- Upcoming changes in Jmeter JTL reporting
New coloumn titled "SentBytes" has been added in Jmeter JTL reporting file. This was a Jmeter bug fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60229 
In addition, Jmeter aggregate report has added Sent KB/s calculation to aggregate report.  This is an addition to the existing KB/s column.

These changes are verified on  https://builds.apache.org/job/JMeter-trunk/5505/  

Jmeters plugins need to be aware of these new columns and to be able to calculate the current and the new format of Jmeter JTL.
Also, Jmeter plugins need to add the sent KB/s reporting to all the reports and graphs (For example: SynthesisReport AND Bytes Throughput Over Time)
