AutoStop used when you want to stop test on some runtime criteria.
Currently 3 criteria available: average response time, average latency and error rate.

This criteria are used in OR logic, the component will ask JMeter to stop test
if one of the criteria has been met.
After 5 tries of "shutdown test" component will switch to more insistent "stop test",
after 5 more it will try to "stop NOW".

On initiating "shutdown test" AutoStop will create environment variable "auto_stopped" = "true" 
which can be checked later in order to take additional actions on test failure (e.g. send alert).

== AutoStop on Response Time/Latency ==

There is combo-box switching which result parameter to use in conditions: response time or latency.
Test will be stopped only if specified response time/latency exceeded for _sequentially_ N seconds.
To disable auto-stop on time criteria, just set time value to zero.

== AutoStop on Error Rate ==

Error rate specified in percent. Rate can be float number.
Test will be stopped only if specified error rate exceeded for _sequentially_ N seconds.
To disable auto-stop on rate criteria, just set error rate to zero.
