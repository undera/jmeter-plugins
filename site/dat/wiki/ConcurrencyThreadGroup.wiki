This plugin was implemented by _[http://blazemeter.com/?utm_source=jmplinnerpages&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=jmpininnerpgs&utm_campaign=JMeter%2BPlug%2BIn%2BWiki BlazeMeter Inc.]_ and then contributed to community as Open Source.

== Description ==

This thread group offers simplified approach for configuring threads schedule. It is intended to maintain the level of concurrency, which means starting additional during the runtime threads if there's not enough of them running in parallel. Unlike standard Thread Group, it won't create all the threads upfront, so extra memory won't be used. It's a good repacement for [SteppingThreadGroup Stepping Thread Group], since it allows threads to finish their job gracefully.

The preview graph reacts immediately to changes in the fields, showing you the planned concurrency schedule.

== Use With Throughput Shaping Timer Feedback Function ==

When this thread group is used with [ThroughputShapingTimer Throughput Shaping Timer], you may replace Target Concurrency value with a call to the __tstFeedback function to dynamically maintain thread count required to achieve target RPS. When using this approach, leave Concurrency Thread Group Ramp Up Time and Ramp-Up Steps Count fields blank, but be sure to set Hold Target Rate Time to a value equal or greater than the total Duration specified in the Throughput Shaping Timer schedule. See [ThroughputShapingTimer#Schedule-Feedback-Function Throughput Shaping Timer Schedule Feedback Function]for function usage details.
