== Introduction ==
Add this configuration to enable browser based performance testing using Firefox.  This document covers the various configuration options available on the Firefox browser.  For an overview of performing client sider performance testing, refer to the [WebDriverTutorial Web Driver Tutorial].  

Different browsers have different levels of setup complexity.  In the overall scheme of things, using a Firefox Browser is considered to have an *easy level* of setup complexity. However, it is important to realise that due to the rapid releases of Firefox, the latest Firefox version may not work with the latest WebDriver set. The table below describes the version of Firefox that is compatible with JMeterPlugins:

|| JMeterPlugins version || Firefox compatible version ||
|| 1.1.2                 || 22                         ||
|| 1.1.3                 || 26                         ||

*Specific versions of Firefox is available for download at the [https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/ Firefox Website]*.

On startup, the user is presented with the following:

The main part of the Firefox configuration UI lies in the tabs:
  # Proxy
  # Firefox
  #Experiemental

== Proxy ==
The default configuration (Use system proxy) is suitable for most.  However, if you operate within a corporate network (that use http proxies), then this section may be important to you.

=== No proxy ===
Use this option if you *directly connect to the internet*, and your network will *not* make use of any proxies.  

=== Auto-detect proxy settings ===
Some networks will automatically transmit the proxy configuration.  This is especially true for Microsoft Windows networks that make use of WPAD/PAC to transmit the proxy configuration to its host.

=== Use system proxy settings ===
This is the default configuration, and will make use of the network and/or proxy settings configured for your Operating System.

=== Manual proxy configuration ===
This is the most involved, but also allows for the most control of you proxy settings.  

==== HTTP Proxy/Port ====
Specify the name/IP Address of the HTTP proxy server and its associated port to use when the browser makes external network connections.

==== Use HTTP proxy server for all protocols ====
By default this is checked, as most environments use the same HTTP Proxy server for its SSL, FTP and SOCKS connections.  However, if this is not the case, then uncheck this option, and override the settings for the other connections.

==== HTTPS Proxy/Port ====
Specify the name/IP Address of the HTTPS proxy server and its associated port to use when the browser makes external network connections.

==== FTP Proxy/Port ====
Specify the name/IP Address of the FTP proxy server and its associated port to use when the browser makes external network connections.

==== SOCKS Proxy/Port ====
Specify the name/IP Address of the SOCKS proxy server and its associated port to use when the browser makes external network connections.

==== No Proxy for =====
This is a comma separated list of all host(s) and/or IP Address(es) that will bypass the proxy server.

=== Automatic proxy configuration URL ===
For networks that have a proxy configuration server (PAC), and its name and the location of the PAC file is known, please use this option.  The usual configuration for this is {{{http://proxy-server/proxy.pac}}}

== Firefox ==
This tab is intentionally left empty.  As more features get added, this tab will contain customisations specific to the Firefox browser instance used for the tests.  See the [Roadmap] document for future plans.

== Experimental ==
As new features from the [Roadmap] are added, new and experimental features will generally get added to this section first.  This allows the early adopters to use these features and provide feedback on them.  However, it should be recognised that *all features added to this tab are subject to change/removal* so depend on them at your own peril!
