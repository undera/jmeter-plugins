Performance testing with JMeter can be done with several JMeter injectors (on a remote host) and one JMeter controller (with GUI, on your local host).
Templates are sent to JMeter injectors using RMI protocol.
Results are brought back periodically to the JMeter controller.
Unfortunately the dataset and csv files aren't transferred from the controller to injectors.

The main idea is to use a tiny http server in JMeter Plugins to manage the dataset files with simple commands to get / add rows of data in files.

Configuration can also be done in the jmeter.properties file

If you want automatically start a Simple Table Server on JMeter startup simply add "startup-simple-table-server.bsh" in the "beanshell.init.file" property.
Be sure that startup-simple-table-server.bsh file is in your JMETER_HOME/bin directory.
