= Installing Plugins =

The easiest way to get the plugins is to install [/wiki/PluginsManager/ Plugins Manager]. Then you'll be able to install any other plugins just by clicking a checkbox.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Download *[/get/ plugins-manager.jar]* and put it into {{{lib/ext}}} directory, then restart JMeter.
</div>

If you experience any issues with plugins installation, don't hesitate to ask at [/support/ Support Forums].
