Merge Results is a useful tool to compare two or more results files

Simply add two or more files (max 4) in the table, you can add filter on label or offset.
The results file is made from input files concatenated with a new reference date.
Each label is prefixed by the one specified in the table (ie: TEST1:LOGIN, TEST2:LOGIN, TEST3:LOGIN...).

The newly created file can be read by classical JMeter report or graph.
