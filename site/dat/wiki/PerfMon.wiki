=Introduction=

During a load test, it is important to know the health of the servers loaded. 
It is also nice to see if you are targeting a cluster if the load is correctly 
dispatched. To address this, the plugin package now supports server monitoring!
Using it, you can monitor [PerfMonMetrics CPU, Memory, Swap, Disks I/O and Networks I/O]
on [http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home#Home-overview almost all platforms]!

Here is how the plugin looks like. It shows the CPU usage of 4 servers involved in the load test:

=Metrics collected=

Since version 0.5.0 the Server Agent tool supports collecting over 75 system metrics.
[PerfMonMetrics See full list].

=How it works=

==Concept==

JMeter cannot retrieve by default server metrics except Tomcat ones. 
To overcome this situation, we have developed a server agent which will get 
performance data for JMeter. The agent uses 
the [http://support.hyperic.com/display/SIGAR/Home SIGAR] open source library. 
It is composed of a Java common part and native libraries per OS.

==Installation==

Server Agent tool detailed description is placed [PerfMonAgent here].

=Usage=
==GUI Mode==
In GUI mode, just add the listener, define servers and metric types to monitor, 
ensure the agent is running at remote server and is not blocked by a firewall, 
then run the test. The values will be displayed at real time chart.

==Non GUI Mode==
If you run JMeter in non GUI mode and want to save monitoring data to file, 
just configure result file saving in GUI as you do with other listeners. After 
running the test you may load saved file into GUI and see the values timeline.

==JMeter Properties==

  * jmeterPlugin.perfmon.interval - metrics collection interval in milliseconds
  * jmeterPlugin.perfmon.useUDP - true/false, enabling UDP connection try after failed TCP connection attempt

== Seeing PerfMon Data Online ==

There is a feature on [http://loadosophia.org/?utm_source=jpgc&utm_medium=wiki&utm_campaign=PerfMon Loadosophia.org] to see PerfMon collected data in a fancy Web interface.
[https://loadosophia.org/examples/62562/?utm_source=jpgc&utm_medium=wiki&utm_campaign=PerfMon#tab=4 Here's an example].
