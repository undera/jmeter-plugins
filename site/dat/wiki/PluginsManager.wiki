<div class="alert alert-warning">
This feature in in BETA state. [http://atkritka.com/upload/iblock/978/atkritka_1378399932_735.jpg? Better than nothing], but it can ruin your JMeter installation.
Consider using it with non-production installations only.
Report any issues on our [/support/ support forums].<br/><br/>Get the beta build [http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=kg/apc/jmeter-plugins-manager/0.6/jmeter-plugins-manager-0.6.jar jmeter-plugins-manager-0.6.jar from here].

The idea of JMeter Plugins Manager is simple: instead of installing various plugins manually, it will do it for you through nice UI.
No need to mess with JARs anymore. Install Plugins Manager once and it will do it all for you: installing, upgrading, uninstalling.

The plugins it manages include usual plugins from JMeter-Plugins.org, various third-party plugins and even core JMeter plugins.
This is important, because removing rarely used features like JDBC and LDAP will tidy up huge popup menus from unused items. As a bonus you will get the increased JMeter startup time.

You can observe the catalogue of plugins [/catalogue/ here]. As the first experiment, try to uninstall all the plugins and see how bare JMeter looks like. Then install something. Then install something more. Have fun!

== Installation and Usage ==

Download the Plugins Manager JAR file and put it into JMeter's {{{lib/ext}}} directory. Then start JMeter and go to "Options" menu to access the Plugins Manager.

The label on the menu item will say "has upgrades" in case any of your installed plugins have upgrades for it.

Clicking on menu item will bring up the plugins manager dialog:

The dialog has three tabs, "Review Changes" area and "Apply" button. Removing ticks from plugins on "Installed" tab will uninstall them. Setting ticks on "Available" tab will install the plugin. 

The plugins that have upgrades will show in the list with _italic font_. Choose the new version you want to install for them from "Version" drop-down. By default, all upgradable plugins are selected for upgrade and listed on "Upgrades" tab.

The "Review Changes" pane is important, it lists all the changes that supposed to be done after you click "Apply" button.
Sometimes plugins have dependencies from each other, so there might be additional plugins uninstalled. There is no hurry for important business, so review the changes prior to applying it.

Right mouse click over checkbox lists opens "Toggle All" option, which takes some time to toggle all items in the list.

== Add Your Favorite Plugin ==

Now there is an opportunity for anyone who creates the JMeter plugins to quickly make them available for wide audience of JMeter-Plugins.org.
You don't need to contribute your source code into our repository, you can just create your project and maintain it, just using JPGC as distribution infrastructure.
If you are interested, please raise the topic on our [/support/ community forum] to get more detailed instructions.

As a related note: there is a intention to split existing plugin sets from JPGC into smaller pieces that would fit users better.
Main goal is not to ship undesired plugins into popup menus to not distract JMeter users from their main job.

== Usage Statistics Collected ==

By default, Plugins Manager sends some anonymous information to JMeter-Plugins.org, including: full version of JMeter used, list of installed plugins with their versions, unique ID for the installation.
We would love to analyze that information to learn more about which plugins deserve more development according to their popularity. Also, we plan to publish some interesting stats from that information in the future.
The information is completely anonymous, you can validate that through our source code. You are free to disable these reporting by setting {{{jpgc.repo.sendstats=false}}} in JMeter properties.


== Using from BeanShell or JSR223 ==

If you need to access the plugins versions information from scriptable components like BeanShell sampler, please use these two methods:

=== Single Plugin Info ===

Request for single plugin version, returns version string if plugin is installed, or null if plugin is not installed:
 
{{{
org.jmeterplugins.repository.PluginManager.getPluginStatus("jpgc-graphs-basic")
}}}

Example result of this function call is string like {{{1.3.0}}}.

=== All Plugins Info ===

Returns a string containing plugin IDs with corresponding versions. Only the installed plugins are listed.

{{{
org.jmeterplugins.repository.PluginManager.getAllPluginsStatus()
}}}

Example result of this function call is string like {{{[jpgc-graphs-basic=1.3.1, jpgc-sense=1.3.1, jpgc-cmd=1.3.1, jpgc-graphs-composite=1.3.1, jpgc-csl=1.3.1, jpgc-functions=1.3.1, jpgc-dummy=1.3.1, jpgc-ffw=1.3.1, jmeter-http=2.13, jpgc-fifo=1.3.1, jmeter-core=2.13, jpgc-mergeresults=1.3.1, jpgc-perfmon=1.3.1, jpgc-synthesis=1.3.1, jpgc-plancheck=1.3.1, jpgc-tst=1.3.1, jmeter-components=2.13]}}}.

== Plugins Manager from Command-Line ==

If you want to use the Plugins Manager in an automated fashion, you will need to make some preparations first:
 
  # make sure {{{cmdrunner-2.0.jar}}} is present in {{{jmeter/lib}}} directory. If not, take it from here: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=kg/apc/cmdrunner/2.0/cmdrunner-2.0.jar
  # make sure {{{PluginsManagerCMD.sh}}} or {{{PluginsManagerCMD.bat}}} is present in {{{jmeter/bin}}} directory. If not, run {{{java -cp jmeter/lib/ext/jmeter-plugins-manager-0.8.jar org.jmeterplugins.repository.PluginManagerCMDInstaller}}} to have the files created
    
Now, you can use {{{PluginsManagerCMD}}} to get the status of plugins, install or uninstall them. The command-line is simple:

{{{
PluginsManagerCMD <command> [<params>]
}}}

Where {{{command}}} is one of "status", "install", "uninstall".
{{{params}}} is a string with plugin IDs, comma-separated, like this: {{{jpgc-cmd,jpgc-json,jpgc-casutg}}}. No spaces allowed currently. If you want to specify exact versions for plugins, do it like this: {{{jpgc-json=2.2,jpgc-casutg=2.0}}}
