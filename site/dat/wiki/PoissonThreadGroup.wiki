== Description ==
Theard arrivals in this group are based on a poisson process _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process]. 

The threads will arrive at an average rate of "lambda" threads per second. Keeping similar random seed value across experiments will ensure similar arrival pattern of the threads. This should allow for test to be reproducable.
