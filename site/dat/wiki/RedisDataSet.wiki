== Description ==

Redis Data Set requests data from a Redis server and converts to JMeter variables. This allows data to be served from a single Redis server across multiple JMeter slave instances during a test, without needing to split the file or handle duplicate rows of data.

The plugin has the following features:

  * Automatic conversion to JMeter variables
  * Data can be retrieved from a Redis List or Set
  * Recycle or removal of test data on use
  * Thread stop when no more data available
  * Multiple concurrent JMeter clients from a single Redis instance
  * Support for password-protected Redis instances

Data is loaded to Redis under a key, where each entry is a string that is delimited into one or more variables. See [#loadingDataToRedis Loading Data to Redis] below.

In the following example, there are 2 Redis databases, 0 and 1. Database 0 has 2 index keys, ccKeys and userName.

{{{
+- 0
   +- ccKeys
      +- "123456,1234"
      +- "123457,1235"
      +- "123458,1236"
   +- userName
      +- "user1"
      +- "user2"
      +- "user3"
}}}

== Redis Lists vs Sets ===

List
* Data retrieved sequentially
* Supports repeated or duplicate data

Set
* Data retrieved randomly
* Data is unique within the set (adding duplicate data is ignored)

=== Data Configuration ===

This section describes how the data is stored within Redis and how it should be mapped to JMeter Variables. All options in this section are mandatory.

  * Redis Key : The list or set name
  * Variable Names : The names of variables exported by Data Set to Test elements. These are the equivalent of CSV column headers in the CSV Data Set.
  * Delimiter : Separator used within row stored in Redis List or Set
  * Data Source Type : Whether the data is loaded to Redis as a List or Set
  * Recycle Data on Use : Whether data can be re-used, or should be removed from Redis on use. If true, then data will be re-used, across multiple iterations, threads and load generators. If false, then data will be *consumed* upon use. Once the data is exhausted, no further iterations will be executed. This is useful if you must ensure unique data is used across load generators.

=== Connection Configuration ===

The following options are mandatory:

  * Redis Server Host : Hostname of the Redis server.
  * Redis Server Port : This will typically be the standard Redis port 6379.
  * Database : Redis database, typically set to 0.

The following options are optional:

  * Timeout for connection (ms)
  * Password for connection : Add password for Redis databases that require authentication

=== Redis Pool Configuration ===

These options are controlled by the Apache Commons Pool library, and are described in more detail in the [https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-pool/api-1.6/org/apache/commons/pool/impl/GenericObjectPool.html API page for that project].

[=#loadingDataToRedis]
== Loading Data to Redis ==

It is typically most efficient to load data to Redis using [https://redis.io/topics/mass-insert pipe mode], `redis-cli --pipe`.

An input CSV file that looks like this:

{{{
   ccNum,expiryDate
   123456,1234
   123457,1235
   123458,1236
}}}

would first need to be converted to a Redis-compatible input format before being loading into a List with an index key ccList:

{{{
LPUSH ccList 123456,1234
LPUSH ccList 123457,1235
LPUSH ccList 123458,1236
}}}

or, in the case of a Set, with an index key ccSet:

{{{
SADD ccSet 123456,1234
SADD ccSet 123457,1235
SADD ccSet 123458,1236
}}}

In the below example, we declare a Redis Data Set which exports cardNumber variable from a Redis List using a key ccList and then use it in a Debug Sampler:

[=#TechnicalDetails]
== Technical Details ==

The RedisDataSet uses the [https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis Jedis Java Redis library] for connection and access operations.

For data loaded into a Redis set, RedisDataSet uses [/path/to/redis/url spop] and [https://redis.io/commands/sadd sadd] commands.

For data loaded into a Redis list, RedisDataSet uses [https://redis.io/commands/lpop lpop] and [https://redis.io/commands/rpush rpush] commands.
