Similar to the Response Times Over Time that displays the average response times in discrete time intervals,
this graph shows response times percentiles in those time intervals.

By default, the 50th, 90th, 95th and 99th percentile are plotted.

This can be configured via a JMeter property like so: {{{jmeterPlugin.percentilesOverTime=50,90,99,99.9}}}

Caveat: The percentiles are not calculated exactly but estimated via the P-Square algorithm
(reference: [https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/psqr.htm]).
