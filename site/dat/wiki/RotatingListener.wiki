== Description ==

Rotating JTL Listener is a feature, that allows writing sequence of files, limited by number of samples per file.
This enables recorded file to be handled in some background process, archived/deleted for saving free space.
File names form sequence like "result.jtl => result.1.jtl => result.2.jtl".
