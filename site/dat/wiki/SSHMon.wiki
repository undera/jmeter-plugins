=Introduction=
SSHMon collects performance metrics that are returned from a command remotely executed over an SSH connection.
Those metrics can be plotted over time and/or written to file (CSV/JTL).

=Usage=
From the context menu, select "Add" / "Listeners" / "SSHMon Samples Collector".
Add one row for each metric to be collected with the following settings:
  * Label: Name of the metric (for chart and file)
  * Host: Hostname or IP address of the remote server
  * Port: TCP port the server's SSH daemon is listening (usually 22)
  * Username: For remote authentication
  * Private Key (PEM): (Optional) For public-key authentication; actual content of the private key file (from a JMeter property or via ${__FileToString(pem_file)})
  * Password: User's password (for password authentication) or private key password (for public-key authentication)
  * Command: The command to be executed on the remote server
  * Delta: Flag that indicates whether to plot the absolute value (delta=false) or the difference (delta=true) from the previous sample

==Configuration==

==JMeter Properties==
  * {{{jmeterPlugin.sshmon.interval}}} - metrics collection interval in milliseconds
  * {{{forceSSHMonFile}}} - (true/false) makes sure JMeter writes metrics to CSV file in the current directory if no filename is specified
