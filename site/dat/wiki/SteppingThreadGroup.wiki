JMeter have only one out-of-the-box option for threads (users) scheduling: simple ramp-up. But many users, especially with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_LoadRunner HP LoadRunner] experience miss more flexible thread scheduling algorythm. Stepping Thread Group adds to JMeter thread scheduling similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_LoadRunner LoadRunner]'s.

In JMeter version 2.4 new plugin type was introduced: custom Thread Groups. Stepping Thread Group is the first custom thread group in the world.

However, time goes by and probably better alternative has been offered: [ConcurrencyThreadGroup Concurrency Thread Group]

== Features ==
  * preview graph showing estimated load (see example screen below)
  * initial thread group delay to combine several thread group activities
  * increase load by portions of threads (users) with ramp-up period
  * configurable hold time after all threads started
  * decrease load by portions

== Example ==

Following screenshot shows Stepping Thread Group set to generate load increasing by 10 users each 2 minutes:

Actual test run shows following activity graph:
