Synthesis Report is a mix between Summary Report and Aggregate Report:
Samples, Average, Min, Max, 90% Line, Std. Dev, Error %, Throughout, KB/sec, Avg.Bytes
It is possible to include/exclude some samples by adding their labels (with comma separator) or a regular expression in the include/exclude field.
It is also possible to restrict on an specified time interval (Start/End Offset).
