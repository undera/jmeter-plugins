==Filtering Samples==

You may ignore results by sampler names, setting Include/Exclude criteria
at Rows tab. Multiple labels may be specified using comma as separator.

==Saving the Outputs==
[/img/wiki/chartPopup.png]
===Saving Image===
You can either copy the Graphs to clipboard or save them to a PNG image file
by right-clicking them and using the pop-up menu:
===Saving Data===
You can also export the data of the chart in a csv file using the same pop-up.

==Filtering Rows==

You can show/hide rows using the *Rows Selector Tab*:

==Tuning the Graphs Plugins==

You have the possibility to fine tune the rendering and some aspects
of the plugins using the *Settings Tab*. 
Please note that all the options are not available for all Graphs,
it depends of the type of Graph you are using. The Settings Panel is adapted to each Graph.
A preview panel will show in real time the impact of the changes.

===Time Line Settings===
====Group Values Interval====
By default, the Graphs plugins are aggregating the values received by JMeter for intervals of 500 ms or 1 sec. You can change this default value for a bigger one if you plan to have long test runs. It will result in less memory used, lesser points in the Graphs. The drawback is you will loose some granularity as this option has impact on the metrics collected. It is recommended to use instead the [SettingsPanel#Limit_number_of_points_in_row Limit number of points] option, except if you have real memory problems because of huge tests. This option will be saved in the test plan.

=== Standard / Aggregate Display ===

This option is very useful as it gives you 2 graphs in one.
You can get either a detailed display, which consist of one row per sample,
or an aggregated one, which will average or sum (depending of the graph type)
all the values and display a single row. Note you can switch in real time between them.
This option is saved in the test plan.

=== Relative Time ===

This option will display time based graphs X axis relative to the test start time.

|| *Standard time* || *Relative time* ||

===Rendering Options===
Some of these options can be set globally using the user.properties file as described in the [PluginInstall installation procedure].<br>
You can change them dynamically during the test, they will not be saved in the test plan.

====Paint Gradient====
Enable or disable the gradient paint as background of the chart. It may be useful to remove it if you plan to print the chart.

|| *Gradient enabled* || *Gradient disabled* ||

====Draw Zeroing Lines====
This option draw at the beginning and at the end of each row a vertical
line from the point to the horizontal axis. It can be nice for the thread
state over time graph for instance.

|| *Without Final zeroing lines* || *With Final zeroing lines* ||
|| [/img/wiki/settings/normal.png] || [http://jmeter-plugins.googlecode.com/svn-history/wiki/img/settings/final_zeroing_lines.png] ||

====Draw Current X Line====
This option will draw a vertical line to show which value is updated in the chart. This can be used for non time based Graphs, such as Response time vs Threads:

|| *With Draw current X line enabled* ||
|| [/img/wiki/settings/draw_current_x.png]||

====Limit Number of Points in Row====
This is the most helpful option. It will dynamically reduce the number of points of the rows for better readability. You just specify how many maximum points can be displayed, and the chart will adapt itself. *This can be enabled/disable in real time, with no impact on the metrics collected*.

|| *Normal display* || *Display with limit number of point enabled* ||
|| [/img/wiki/settings/normal2.png] || [http://jmeter-plugins.googlecode.com/svn-history/wiki/img/settings/limit_nb_points.png] ||

====Prevent X Axis Range to Adapt to Outliers====

This option is used only for the Response Time Distribution graph.
By selecting it, it will prevent the graph to be scaled for outliers values.
In the following example, you can see there was a timeout which occurs during the test.
The impact on the chart is the X axis scales itself to display this value,
and all other ones become difficult to see. By selecting this option,
these kind of values will be ignored when drawing the graph.

====Hide Non-representative Points====

This option is used for graphs with thread count as X axis.
For these kind of graphs, we can expect to see values based
on the ramp up strategy used. For instance, in the following ramp up,
we expect to see values for (10, 20, 30, ... , 100) users:

[/img/wiki/settings/rampup.png]

But during the test, at some point of time we have different count during
the ramp up or ramp down between 2 steps. And this will show non-representative values,
as we may have only few of them for a given thread count.

This option is here to remove these non representative points.
