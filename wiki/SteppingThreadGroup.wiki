JMeter have only one out-of-the-box option for threads (users) scheduling: simple ramp-up. But many users, especially with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_LoadRunner HP LoadRunner] experience miss more flexible thread scheduling algorythm. Stepping Thread Group adds to JMeter thread scheduling similar to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_LoadRunner LoadRunner]'s.

In JMeter version 2.4 new plugin type was introduced: custom Thread Groups. Stepping Thread Group is the first custom thread group in the world.

== Features ==
 * preview graph showing estimated load (see example screen below)
 * initial thread group delay to combine several thread group activities
 * increase load by portions of threads (users) with ramp-up period
 * configurable hold time after all threads started
 * decrease load by portions

== Example ==
